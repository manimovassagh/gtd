# GTD Task Manager

This application aims to help you implement the Getting Things Done (GTD) method for personal productivity. By using the core principles of GTD, this task manager will guide you through capturing, clarifying, organizing, reflecting, and engaging with your tasks efficiently.

## Principles of the Application

1. **Capture Everything:**
   - The goal is to free your mind from storing tasks, ideas, and commitments.
   - Quickly add tasks from anywhere in the app, ensuring no idea is lost.
   - Input methods will be simple and frictionless, allowing you to capture tasks in seconds.

2. **Clarify:**
   - For each captured item, determine what it really means.
   - Decide if it is actionable and what the next step is.
   - Items can be classified as tasks, reference info, or someday/maybe ideas.

3. **Organize:**
   - Once clarified, tasks are sorted into appropriate lists, such as:
     - **Next Actions:** Tasks that are actionable and ready to be done.
     - **Projects:** Larger outcomes that require multiple steps.
     - **Waiting For:** Tasks waiting on input or action from others.
     - **Someday/Maybe:** Ideas you might pursue in the future.
   - Use context tags (e.g., @home, @work) to quickly see relevant tasks.

4. **Reflect:**
   - Review your lists regularly to keep your system up-to-date.
   - Perform weekly reviews to ensure all tasks are correctly categorized, and your focus areas are aligned with your priorities.
   - The app will provide a dashboard to help you quickly spot overdue or upcoming tasks and identify where you need to put your attention.

5. **Engage:**
   - Choose what to do based on context, time available, and priority.
   - The app’s interface will guide you to the next actions that make the most sense in your current situation.
   - By following the GTD principles, you’ll have a clear mind and a trusted system, enabling you to act confidently.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React with Tailwind CSS or Shadcn UI for building a responsive, accessible, and modern UI.
- **Backend:** TypeScript-based backend with SQLite as the database for simplicity and portability.
- **Architecture:** The system will focus on minimal friction, providing quick load times, and a smooth user experience.

## Project Roadmap

1. **Phase 1 - Setup & Basic UI**
   - Initialize React, configure Tailwind or Shadcn.
   - Set up a basic Express or Node.js backend in TypeScript.
   - Integrate SQLite for database storage.

2. **Phase 2 - Core GTD Features**
   - Implement task capture.
   - Implement lists: Inbox, Next Actions, Projects, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe.
   - Basic CRUD operations for tasks and projects.

3. **Phase 3 - Advanced Features**
   - Weekly Review interface.
   - Context tagging (e.g., @home, @work).
   - Filtering and search functionality.
   
4. **Phase 4 - User Experience Enhancements**

   - Sync or backup options.

By adhering to these principles and the GTD methodology, this application aims to provide a trusted, integrated system for managing all of your personal and professional commitments, reducing stress, and increasing productivity.
